# TL;DR {-}

* EcoPlots's ecological data model is observation- and site-centric. Typically, an  observation will belong to a site and will have a site-visit see Figure \@ref(fig:datamodel) below for a graphical representation of concepts and their association.
  * Observations (e.g. number of flowers, plant canopy area and plant biomass in \@ref(fig:datamodel)) are done on [features of interest](https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/information-models/tern-ontology/conceptual-information-model#feature-of-interest) (real world objects you are interested in studying, measuring or observing; the plants (Eucalyptus and Cycad) in Figure \@ref(fig:datamodel)). 
  * All entities in the data model have id's (e.g. observations, FOI's, vocabularies, methods and instruments)
    * Unique Resource Identifiers i.e. (unique sequence of characters) are used for generating the id's 
    * The URI's can be used to locate and get information about that entity (e.g. check out the URI for animal occurrence here [http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/2361dea8-598c-4b6f-a641-2b98ff199e9e](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/2361dea8-598c-4b6f-a641-2b98ff199e9e))
* Multiple observations can be recorded from a feature of interest (FOI). In figure \@ref(fig:datamodel) the Eucalyptus tree (FOI p34rdc) has observations on number of flowers and plant canopy.   
* Data downloaded from the EcoPlots platform comes in a longer format.
  * `featureId` and `observationId` are unique keys for a feature and observation, respectively. These two identifiers are the work-horses for joining and transforming tables (e.g. from the longer to a wider format).
* See the [TERN Ontology](https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/information-models/overview) for more information on our data model and [the conceptual overview of the model](https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/information-models/tern-ontology/conceptual-information-model).

# Introduction

This tutorial shows how to manipulate [EcoPlots's](https://ecoplots.tern.org.au/) plot ecological data downloads, as well as through an API and manipulate the data using R. This document uses the following libraries: `tidyverse`, `kablExtra`, `fs`, `easystats` and `bookdown`, `easystats` and `httr`.


# TERN's data model
First things first, some background:
 	
* The TERN data model is observation-centric
* Each observation belongs to a [feature of interest](https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/information-models/tern-ontology/conceptual-information-model#feature-of-interest) (FOI, i.e. the real world object you are interested on and are measuring things about)
* This model differentiates between [parameters](https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/information-models/tern-ontology/conceptual-information-model#observations) (i.e. observations, things that are measured directly on the FOI) and [attributes](https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/information-models/tern-ontology/conceptual-information-model#non-core-attributes) (measurements related to the FOI and other data entities).
* TERN Ontology's main focus is to represent site-based ecological surveys. Meaning, that [site](https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/information-models/tern-ontology/conceptual-information-model#site) and [site visits](https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/information-models/tern-ontology/conceptual-information-model#site-visit) are central to the description of the observations (the model can also describe other data types, e.g. occurrence data)
  * A [site](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/5bf7ae21-a454-440b-bdd7-f2fe982d8de4) is a land area selected from within a survey region where the sampling occurs (e.g. plot, transect, quadrat). 
  * [site-visits](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/f5c125b1-81c2-448c-81e6-7ff6a2facd07) are a discrete time when the surveys within the site occurred.


An FOI can have many observations. You can make observations on the height, diameter, wood density of a single tree (see Figure \@ref(fig:datamodel)). Similarly, observations and FOIs can have multiple attributes. For instance, reliability and/or accuracy of an observation are attributes, as well as notes on an observation or sample sizes. 

# EcoPlots download
To download Ecoplots data visit the portal [https://ecoplots.tern.org.au/](https://ecoplots.tern.org.au/). Once in there click on the search plot data button to explore (cirlced in red in the figure below, Figure \@ref(fig:landing))

```{r landing, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="EcoPlots landing page"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ecoplots-landing.png")
```

Below you can see a snapshot of the EcoPlots data grid (Figure \@ref(fig:grid)). Using the facets (marked in red on the left hand side of Figure \@ref(fig:grid)) you can filter to specific databases, regions, feature types,  parameters and dates (not shown). Once you have selected the data that you want to query you can trigger a download clicking the add to cart button (top left corner, marked in blue in Figure \@ref(fig:grid)). After adding items to your cart, if you have not already done so,  you will be prompted to sign in to download the data. 

```{r grid, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="EcoPlots facets and data grid"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ecoplots-grid.png")
```

In the download data page you can give your download a title and description (see Figure \@ref(fig:download)).
```{r download, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="EcoPlots download"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ecoplots-download.png")
```

Once you received your download you can always come back to it later (up to two weeks) and if you want to you can keep a permanent copy of it to share by minting a DOI (Figure \@ref(fig:doi) under actions button circled in red)

```{r doi, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="EcoPlots download mint"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ecoplots-mint.png")
```


Now let's look at a EcoPlots download. In the code chunk below we show a download example for [plant specimen data](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/2e122e23-881c-43fa-a921-a8745f016ceb) from the TERN Ecosystem Surveillance database [@Sparrow2022]. 

An EcoPlots download comes in a `package` that contains:

* `bag-info.txt` with:
  * **citation**
  * link to the metadata record
  * licensing
  * download information (e.g. link and download date)
* data folder that contains:
  * Citation in a `.bib` format **citation.bib**
  * Site and site attributes file
    * If other sampling units are used then a file for the sampling unit is included. A transect file is included when the sampling takes place inside a transect inside a site.
  * Site visit and site visit attributes file
  * FOI observations file
  * FOI attributes file
    * If the FOI is an organism then a taxon file is included
  * Data dictionary for all columns in all files

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
dir_tree("data/ecoplots-example/package_9dc09342b70211ec98bc1e69ee627a0b/", recurse= TRUE)
```


Structure and relationships between the data types are provided using URI's. All definitions, methods, and even observations in a data download will have a URI, in the tables this URIs are identified with the `Id` suffix.

## Longer format and tranformation to wider format

EcoPlots downloads come in a longer format. That is the tables by desing increase the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns.The basic columns of the EcoPlots longer format tables are:

* `featureType` is a human readable name for the feature which observation we are interested in. A complete list of all feature types can be found [here](https://linkeddata.tern.org.au/viewer/tern/id/http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/68af3d25-c801-4089-afff-cf701e2bd61d)
* `featureId` column contains single unique identifier for each individual feature
* `parametersName` column that contains the names of the columns in the wide format
* `result` column for sourcing the values that will be used to fill in the named columns above

In general, the conversion from longer to wider format should be achieved by using `featureType` and `featureId` as unique identifiers, the `parametersName` that literally contains the name of the parameters performed on the FOI (observations) and `result` that is the value for a given observation. 
  
In pseudo-code the transformation looks something like the steps below

```
#Reading in the data
data = read_csv("<PACKAGE>/data/<FOI>_observations.csv", na = "N/A")

#Pivoting (i.e. transforming) the data from longer format to wider format
# using the FOI as an id, the parametersName for the column names and results as the values to fill in the rows with
data_wide = pivot_function(id_cols =(featureId), names_column = parametersName, values_column = result)
```

The pseudo-code above should transform a longer table  where the observation names are in `parametersName`
and the observation values in `result` to a wide table format with features as rows and columns as parameters as below (Table \@ref(tab:l2w)).

```{r l2w, echo= FALSE}
long <- tibble(featureType=c("plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence","plant occurrence "),
featureTypeId=c("plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition","plant-occurrence-definition"),

parameterNameId= c("plant-height-definition","wood-density-definition","dbh-definition","abovegroundbiomass-definition","plant-height-definition","wood-density-definition","dbh-definition","abovegroundbiomass-definition","plant-height-definition","wood-density-definition","dbh-definition","abovegroundbiomass-definition"),
parametersName= c("plantHeight","woodDensity","dbh","AGB","plantHeight","woodDensity","dbh","AGB","plantHeight","woodDensity","dbh","AGB"),
result= c(100,0.9,300,10000,20,0.5,100,1000,5,0.65,40,500))

wide <- tibble( featureId=c("plant_occurr_id-54678013","plant_occurr_id-54308023","plant_occurr_id-54313884"),
plantHeight = c(100,20,5),
woodDensity= c(0.9,0.5,0.65),
dbh= c(300,100,40),
AGB= c(10000,1000,500))

kbl(long, caption = "**Longer format**") %>%
kable_paper(position = "left") %>%
  scroll_box(width = "500px", height = "200px") %>%
  kable_styling( position = "float_left", bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

```


# Data manipulation examples with EcoPlots Download

Below we provide examples of how to manipulate site, site-visit and FOI tables, we show how to:

* Transform tables from the longer format to a wider format (e.g. with a column for each type of observation)
  * **site table does not require transformation** (i.e. each site attribute already has its own column) 
  * site attributes tables
  * FOI and FOI attributes tables
* Join tables
  * Site and site attribute tables
  * FOI with FOI attributes tables
  * site and FOI tables
  * FOI's with environmental variables

**Notice** that units are provided in the `resultUnit` column. However, units are not needed to transform or join tables. 

## Transforming tables

EcoPlots download comes in a longer format. Below we show on how to transform the long format to a wider format using site data and plant occurrence data. The basic workflow is to first identifying the unique id's that link multiple observations (appended with `id`, see Figure \@ref(fig:foi-transform-pic)), then identifying the columns that contain the column names (e.g. for FOI's `parameters` and for attributes `attributeName`) and finally the columns that contain the observations/values (e.g. for FOI's `result` and for attributes `values`). In the image below we provide an example of id's linking multiple observations to a single FOI.

```{r foi-transform-pic, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Unique identifier link multiple observations to their FOI"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/foi-transform.png")

```


### Transform site attributes table

Each site attribute has an URI, and points to a site through a `siteId` (Table \@ref(tab:site-att)). 
```{r site-att-read, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#read in table
site_att <- read_csv("data/ecoplots-example/package_9dc09342b70211ec98bc1e69ee627a0b/data/site_attribute_a90cdf26053fa1e844fc822c91b49286.csv", na = "N/A") 

```


```{r site-att, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# site_att %>%
#   kbl() %>%
#   kable_paper() %>% 
#   scroll_box(width = "700px", height = "200px")


kbl(site_att, caption = "**Site attribute table**") %>%
kable_paper() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "700px", height = "200px") 
#transform from wide to long format

```


To transform the site attributes table (Table \@ref(tab:site-att)) to the wider format (Table \@ref(tab:site-att-to-wide-dis)) the `siteId` can be used as the unique key,  the `attributeName` for the names of the columns, and the `value` column for the values.

```{r, site-att-to-wide, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
#read in table
site_att %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols=c(siteId),names_from = attributeName,values_from= value)-> site_att_wide
```

```{r, site-att-to-wide-dis, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

kbl(site_att_wide, caption = "**Site attribute wider table**") %>%
kable_paper() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "700px", height = "200px") 

```

### Transform FOI observations and attributes tables

We first load the plant specimen data (Table \@ref(tab:plant-table)).

```{r, plantLong, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}

plant_specimen_long <- read_csv("data/ecoplots-example/package_9dc09342b70211ec98bc1e69ee627a0b/data/plant-specimen_observations_a90cdf26053fa1e844fc822c91b49286.csv", na = "N/A")
```


```{r plant-table, echo = FALSE}
out <- slice_sample(plant_specimen_long,n = 50)

kbl(out, caption = "**Plant specimen longer table**") %>%
kable_paper() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "700px", height = "200px") 


```

 Then we transform the table into wide format using as keys `siteName, siteId, siteVisitName,transectName, featureId`. Notice how after transformation each parameter exist in its own column (Table \@ref(tab:psw)). 

```{r psw-pivot}
plant_specimen_long %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols=c(featureId,siteId,siteVisitId),names_from = parameter,values_from= result) -> plant_specimen_wide
```


```{r psw, echo = FALSE}
kbl(plant_specimen_wide, caption = "**Plant specimen wider table**") %>%
kable_paper() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "700px", height = "200px") 


```


The same transformation can be done with the FOI attributes tables. Once we read in the data we can use the `featureId` as unique identifier for the features. The column names are stored in  `attributeName` and their values in `value` column. The end result is a table with a row for each feature (i.e. each plant specimen) and each of their attributes as columns (Table \@ref(tab:foi-att-wide)). 

```{r, foi-att, message=FALSE}
plant_specimen_att_long <- read_csv(file = "data/ecoplots-example/package_9dc09342b70211ec98bc1e69ee627a0b/data/plant-specimen_feature_attribute_a90cdf26053fa1e844fc822c91b49286.csv", na = "N/A")

#transform from longer to wider format
plant_specimen_att_long %>%
pivot_wider(id_cols=c(featureId),names_from = attributeName,values_from= value)-> plant_specimen_att_wide
```

 



```{r,foi-att-wide, echo = FALSE}

kbl(plant_specimen_att_wide, caption = "**Plant specimen attributes wider table**") %>%
kable_paper() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "700px", height = "200px") 

```

## Joining tables
Below we show how to join tables. For joing tables the only thing we need is to identify the unique id's that link multiple observations to a feature. For sites and their attributes this is the `siteId`, for FOI's and their attributes this is the `featureId`. For joining different  FOI's the common `id` would be the `siteId`. 


### Join site, site-visit
Sites and their attributes can be joined using their common id's (i.e.`siteId` column). Here we load the site table and use the site attribute wider table from above (Table \@ref(tab:site-all)).


```{r, site-read, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}

## site attribute load 
<<site-att-read>>

#site attr transform
<<site-att-to-wide>>

# site table load
site <- read_csv("data/ecoplots-example/package_9dc09342b70211ec98bc1e69ee627a0b/data/site_a90cdf26053fa1e844fc822c91b49286.csv", na = "N/A") 

#join tables
site_all <- left_join(site, site_att_wide, by = c("siteId"))

```


```{r site-all, message=FALSE}

kbl(site_all, caption = "**Site table with attributes**") %>%
kable_paper() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "1000px", height = "200px") 

```



### FOI tables with FOI attributes tables

The FOI's id (i.e. `featureId`) can be used to join attributes to their observations

```{r, join-foi-obs-att, message=FALSE}
#we load the plant specimen data
<<plantLong>>
#and transform it from longer to wider format
<<psw-pivot>>

#We do the same for its attributes
<<foi-att>>

#finalyy we join the data using the commond key, inthis case the featureId
plant_observations_joined <- left_join(plant_specimen_wide, plant_specimen_att_wide, by = "featureId")
```

### FOI with sites

The common key between an FOI and a site table is the `siteId`, to join an FOI with site data we use this key. 

```{r, join-site-foi}

plants_site <- left_join(site_all, plant_observations_joined, by = "siteId")

```

```{r,plant-site-tbl, message=FALSE}
#show join

plants_site %>%
  slice_sample(n = 50)%>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper() %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "800px", height = "200px")
```

```{r,foi-site-tbl, message=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
#show join

plants_site %>%
  slice_sample(n = 50)%>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper() %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "800px", height = "200px")
```



### Join two FOI's

Information between FOI's can be join using the `siteId` key. In the example below we show how to join data on precipitation to plant species richness to explore their relationship. Macroecological studies have show species richness increases along gradients in precipitation [e.g. @currie1991energy; @harrison2020climate]. To analyse this relationship at a continental scale we use TERN Ecosystem Surveillance database [@Sparrow2022].

After obtaining the [plant specimen](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/2e122e23-881c-43fa-a921-a8745f016ceb) and [climate](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/6d40d71e-58cd-4f75-8304-40c01fe5f74c) data from EcoPlots, we:

1. Load the tables for both FOI's (i.e. climate and plant specimen)

```{r, load-fois,message=FALSE}
#load climate
climate <- read_csv("data/ecoplots-example/package_470a7deeb93411ec9ad65ac04d8860c6/data/climate_observations_4ea343b4c06ff7e7ae998e498263761c.csv", na = "N/A")


plant_specimen <- read_csv("data/ecoplots-example/package_470a7deeb93411ec9ad65ac04d8860c6/data/plant-specimen_observations_4ea343b4c06ff7e7ae998e498263761c.csv", na = "N/A")

```

2. Transform the tables from their long format to a wider format.
  * In the case of the climate data we can filter the only variable that we need (precipitation), this can be done directly in EcoPlots' facet or filtering the parameter in R (e.g. `filter(parameter == "precipitation annual mean")`). 

```{r, rain-trans,message=FALSE}

climate %>%
  filter(parameter == "precipitation annual mean") %>% #notice that we select only precipitation, this can be done in EcoPlots
  pivot_wider(id_cols=c(featureId,siteId,siteVisitId),names_from = parameter,values_from= result)-> climate_wide


```

  * Plant specimens data is transform to wide format using the same keys as the climate data.

```{r, rich-trans,message=FALSE}

plant_specimen %>%
pivot_wider(id_cols=c(featureId,siteId,siteVisitId),names_from = parameter,values_from= result) -> plant_specimen_wide



```

3. Generate species richness and precipitation tables at the site level. Precipitation is a long term average see [here](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/cb2a4d5a-090c-431a-88fe-72afe197c35d). 
  * So one record can be selected at the site level, independent of the number of site visits. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
climate_wide %>% #long term climate is 
  group_by(siteId) %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 1) %>% 
  select(-siteVisitId)-> climate_wide
```
  
  * For calculating plant species richness we can use the the number of rows (i.e. unique number of scientific names) at the site-level. 
  
```{r, message=FALSE}
plant_specimen_wide %>%
  group_by(siteId, siteVisitId) %>%
  count(name = 'richness') %>%
  ungroup()%>%
  group_by(siteId) %>%
  summarise(mean_richness =round(mean(richness, na.rm =TRUE), digits = 0))->plant_richness
```

4. Join the tables. Finally we can join the precipitation and richness tables using their common key (i.e. `siteId`). For making data manipulation easy we transform the spaces in the column names to underscores. 
```{r}

plant_env <- left_join(plant_richness, climate_wide, by = c("siteId")) %>%
  select(-featureId) %>% # we do not need the featureId anymore%>%
  rename_with(.fn = ~ gsub(pattern = " ", replacement = "_", x = .x)) %>%
  mutate(mean_richness = as.integer(mean_richness), precipitation_annual_mean= as.numeric(precipitation_annual_mean)) %>%
  filter(precipitation_annual_mean> 0)# we make sure that our variables are numeric


plant_env %>%
  slice_sample(n = 50)%>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper() %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "800px", height = "200px")

```


5. Visualize and analyse the data. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(plant_env, aes(y = mean_richness, x = precipitation_annual_mean))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", se = F, 
              method.args = list(family = "poisson"), linetype = "dashed")+
  theme_bw()

mod <- glm(mean_richness~precipitation_annual_mean, family = poisson, data = plant_env)
model_parameters(mod)

```



## Working with ground cover data
[Ground cover](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/7dc7ae5c-f074-4536-9032-f59eba3f9270) data is a key ecological indicator use to calibrate remotely sensed data, characterise ecological communities and understand ecosystem process. Ground cover data can be found under the [land surface](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/8282fb22-4135-415c-8ca2-317860d102fb) FOI.

Below we show a workflow on how to manipulate ground cover data. 

First we load the data downloaded from EcoPlots. The ground cover data is divided into the following fractions:

- green
- cryptogam
- cwd
- litter
- rock
- gravel
- outcrop
- bare
- unknown
- not collected

Within a site the fractions add to ~ 100%.

First we load the data, and to make it more convenient to work with, drop the `ground cover - ` from the parameters names to make it easier to manipulate

```{r, ground-cover-long,message=FALSE}

ground_cover_long <- read.csv("data/ecoplots-example/package_a044c5dcd57511ecbeb61e69ee627a0b/data/land-surface_observations_690b2971b1e067b2e2516af1fc8343b8.csv") %>%
  mutate(parameter = str_remove(string = parameter,pattern = 'ground cover - '))

```

Then convert the data to wide format

```{r, ground-cover-wide,message=FALSE}

ground_cover_long %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols=c(featureId,siteId,siteVisitId),
              names_from = parameter,values_from= result)-> ground_cover_wide


```

And add site data and site attributes

```{r, ground-cover-site,message=FALSE}

site_ground <- read_csv("data/ecoplots-example/package_a044c5dcd57511ecbeb61e69ee627a0b/data/site_690b2971b1e067b2e2516af1fc8343b8.csv")

# site_ground_att <- read_csv("data/ecoplots-example/package_a044c5dcd57511ecbeb61e69ee627a0b/data/site_attribute_690b2971b1e067b2e2516af1fc8343b8.csv")

```


Then join the site and ground cover data together using the common key `siteId`

```{r, join-ground-cover,message=FALSE}
ground_all <- left_join(site_ground, ground_cover_wide,by = "siteId")
```

# Access EcoPlots data programatically (using an API)
It is possible to access EcoPlots data programatically using an API call. 

For instruction on how to create an API key see [here](https://ternaus.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TERNSup/pages/2353496065/Create+and+Use+API+Key+to+Access+TERN+Data+Services#How-to-get-a-TERN-API-Key). **Notice that you are only able to see the API key when you create it, so store it somewhere save**, if you loose it you can always generate a new one.

## Generate the API query

Go to [EcoPlots](https://ecoplots.tern.org.au/) and start your ecological data search


```{r}
<<landing>>
```

Select the data that you would like to download using the faceted search on your left (black circle), and then click the API button (circled in red, Figure \@ref(fig:api-button)

```{r api-button, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="EcoPlots landing page"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ecoplots-api-search.png")
```

The API button will display a window with an API generator where you can choose:

- the language for the API call (e.g, C, python, R)
- the end point for the call(analogous to table, e.g. the observation endpoint is the observations table)
- the output format (csv or json)

Once that you are happy with your API call you can copy the code snippet using the copy snippet button on the bottom left

```{r api-call, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="EcoPlots landing page"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ecoplots-api-pop.png")
```

## Run the API query

Below we show an example on how to run an API query to download climate variables in the TERN Surveillance Monitoring database [@Sparrow2022]. 

1. Use the faceted search to select the data (circled in black in Figure \@ref(fig:api-button)
2. Click the API button select the language, variant, endpoint and format and copy the snippet. In this case we will be using:
  - R as a language, which has the variant httr
  - As endpoint we will use observations (the actual climate values)
  - csv as the output format
3. **Remember to enter your API key** in the call where it says `your-api-key`

```{r run-api, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

url = 'https://ecoplots.tern.org.au/api/v1.0/observations?dformat=csv'

payload = '{"query":{"dataset":["http://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/ausplots"],"feature_type":["http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/6d40d71e-58cd-4f75-8304-40c01fe5f74c"],"observed_property":["http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/cb2a4d5a-090c-431a-88fe-72afe197c35d","http://linked.data.gov.au/def/tern-cv/eaa90e7f-7e44-47b1-af26-e5606b9e3cea"]},"page_number":1,"page_size":50}'

response <- POST(
 url = url,
 body = payload,
 add_headers(
  'Content-Type' = 'application/json',
  'X-Api-Key' = 'your-api-key'
 )
)

content <- content(response, as = "text", encoding = 'UTF-8')
```


Read the response 
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
climate_long <- read_csv(content)
```

```{r read-response, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
climate_long <- read_csv(file = "data/ecoplots-example/climate_api_download")
```
and reformat the data
```{r climate-wide,echo=TRUE}

climate_long %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols=c(featureId,siteId,siteVisitId),
              names_from = parameter,values_from= result)-> climate_wide
```


```{r climate-table,echo=FALSE}
climate_wide %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper() %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "800px", height = "200px")


```
